I explored an in-depth analysis of a diverse mobile phones dataset, featuring over 288 models from leading brands including Google, Samsung, realme, Motorola, and more. My work focused on extracting actionable insights and understanding what drives consumer choices in the competitive smartphone landscape.
From price and customer ratings to specs like RAM, battery capacity, color variants, and storage, I mapped out key features and trends influencing buyer preference. This project sharpened my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and strategic reporting—turning raw information into business intelligence
•	Premium devices like Google Pixel 9 and Samsung Galaxy S24 dominate higher price brackets, while budget-friendly options like realme P3x 5G target cost-conscious consumers.
•	Average ratings are consistently high across brands, indicating competitive product quality.
